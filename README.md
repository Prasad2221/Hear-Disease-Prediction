# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model for heart disease using supervised machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a heart disease dataset containing features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, etc.

You can find a similar dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) or UCI ML repository.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checking for null values
   - Encoding categorical data
   - Feature scaling (if needed)

2. **Model Training**
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
   - Fitting a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy on training and testing data
   - Cross-validation (optional)
   - Confusion Matrix and Classification Report (optional)

**This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning.

## Features
- Trained on a heart disease dataset
- Evaluates accuracy on train/test data
- Displays confusion matrix


## Results
- ✅ Training Accuracy: 85%
- ✅ Test Accuracy: 82%
- 📊 Confusion Matrix displayed using matplotlib
